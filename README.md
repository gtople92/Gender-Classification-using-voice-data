# Gender-Classification-using-voice-data

This case study aims at determining the gender through human voice data. We worked on the voice data and predicted through our model whether itâ€™s a male voice or a female. We obtained the dataset from Data.world blog. A database was built using thousands of samples of male and female voices consisting of 3168 rows and 21 columns, each labeled by their gender of male or female. We performed PCA on 20 of our predictors and from the 20 principal components, we chose first 10 to build and train our model. We leveraged 5 different algorithms: KNN, Logistic Regression, Random forest, SVM and Neural Networks. The SVM has the highest accuracy- 97.68% and Random forest has the lowest-96.53%. On the basis of the accuracy and the computation time, we recommend the SVM model.
